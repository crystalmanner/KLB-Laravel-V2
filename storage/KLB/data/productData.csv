day-essence-spf-25-pa,Day Essence SPF 25 PA+,"<p>KOSE Medicated Sekkisei Day Essence SPF 25 PA+ contains the active whitening ingredients permeate deeply into the keratin layer. They serve to control melanin production and inhibit the formation of blotches and freckles caused by excessive sun exposure. KOSE Medicated Sekkisei Day Essence is formulated with a moisture-balance polymer that maintains the balance of skin moisture. As a result, it differs from other UV-block products that tend to produce an uncomfortably sticky feeling. This essence is designed to ensure refreshingly pleasant coverage. Because it neither hardens the skin nor creates a pale complexion after application, it makes an ideal makeup base. As a result, your foundation glides on more easily and provides longer-lasting coverage with a highly even film, preventing the development of a dull skin tone. This essence dries without leaving any white coloring on the skin. As a result, you can apply it anywhere, even on areas that tend to sunburn, such as around the neck, on the back of the hands, and on the arms. The fresh fragrance of Sekkisei clearly awakens the skin to prepare it for makeup application.</p>",KOSE,Moisturizers,"Alcohol, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Brands, Citric Acid, Coix Lacryma, DI-C12-15 Pareth-8 Phosphate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylparaben, Face, Face Moisterizers, Fragrance., Glycerin, Hamamelis Virginia (Witch Hazel) Extract, Jobi (Job's Tears) Seed Extract, Kose, Less than $50, Melothria Heterophylla Extract, Polysorbate 80, Skin Care, Sodium Citrate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethylhexanonin, Tritcum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Water",FALSE,Size,50 ml,,,,,KSX0100041-000-00,1,lb,0,42.17,59,FALSE,'4971710128734,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0256/6140/7277/products/4375.jpg?v=1575499184,1,,,,,25.3,active,0,1

lifting-primer-serum-1,Lifting Primer Serum,"<p>La Mauve Lifting Primer Serum has the following features:<br>This first serum combines various cutting-edge, highly effective ingredients which lift, firm, hydrate and brighten your skin, restoring a younger and radiant look and reversing the signs of aging. <br>SEPILIFT™ DPHP, a patented comprehensive anti-aging ingredient, one of the most powerful of its kind in the 21st century, boosts wrinkle-smoothing, lifting and moisturizing effects. It triggers collagen remodeling and collagen fiber contraction for instant lifting and firming, smoothing different kinds of fine lines. <br>Infused with highly ingenious Snow Algae Powder, which are able to survive the extreme conditions of alpine and polar snow fields. The valuable stress response molecules produced under these extreme environmental conditions can protect the youthfulness of skin effectively. <br>Snow Algae Powder activates biochemical pathways that are essential key factors in a promising longevity theory: the calorie restriction. Calorie restriction, a special dietary regime reduces calorie intake by between 25% and 65%, has been shown in many experiments to improve both the health span and lifespan of individuals. <br>Snow Algae Powder improves the longevity of skin cells by mimicking the effects of caloric restriction. It activates two key factors of the calorie restriction pathway: the Klotho longevity gene and the AMPK energy sensor. <br>The activation of these two pathways leads to improved cellular defenses, cell detoxification and repair, thus helping to stimulate collagen production, rejuvenate the dermal-epidermal junction, reduce dark spots and reinforce skin barrier for a younger, smoother look. <br>Swiss Alps Lipobelle Glacier delivers incomparable and long-lasting hydrating effect, protecting skin against heat-stress effects and providing 24 hour hydration.
